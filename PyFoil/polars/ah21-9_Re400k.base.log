 Current airfoil nodes set from buffer airfoil nodes (  61 )

 WARNING: Poor input coordinate distribution
          Excessive panel angle   58.5  at i =  32
          Repaneling with PANE and/or PPAR suggested
           (doing GDES,CADD before repaneling _may_
            improve excessively coarse LE spacing
